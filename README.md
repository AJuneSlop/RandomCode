# RandomCode
Bits and pieces of random code that I make from time-to-time.

Brightness.ps1 - Powershell script, runs in the background in task scheduler and constantly updates the brightness of the screen.

Volume.ps1 - I used this to mute my system randomly, as CodeRadio would keep playing and it got overwhelming to have it do so all the time. This uses nircmd.exe to run so make sure you have that installed first. You can choose how many seconds of noise you want and how many second of silence.
